Clarifications and discussion points BASELINE data:
1) Missing baseline characteristics: 
- Ethnicity: Only country of birth available
2) Rescue therapy: Tocilizumab (n=12) or increased steroid dose (n=91). steroids_dosechang_yn, steroids_dosechang_date, rescue_yn, rescuedate -> Discuss for sens-analysis
3) Re-discuss the comorbidity list (e.g. autoimmune diseases, cancer, chronic kidney disease // smokers separate?)
4) Missing data for comorbidity subgroup analyses: MICE?
5) No-one received any monoclonal Abs? No-one received any plasma? Any interferons reported?
6) Serology (Serostatus): anti-spike, anti-RBD, anti-N, anti-RBD-Omicron

Discussion points OUTCOME data:
1) VL: Add a cumulative outcome definition (as sens-analysis)?
2) Re QoL: Wait for other trials first. Find out more about the QoL measure used.
3) Get the (S)AE data
4) Discuss changing the adding 28d for death to time to discharge as sensitivity analysis/variable -> discharge_time_sens
