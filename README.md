# JAKi-IPDMA

JAK inhibitor IPDMA

Through this GitHub repository, we collaboratively develop and review the analysis code for a global individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effect of any JAK inhibitor among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 

The study protocol, outlining all pre-specified primary, secondary and subgroup analyses, is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023431817) and available on the project homepage: www.jakinhibitoripdma.org

The project homepage summarizes general project progress including progress in obtaining data from each trial. This project is funded by EU RESPONSE (through EU Horizon 2020) and benefits from a large pan-European trial consortium, patient representatives and WHO COVID-19 treatment guideline team collaborations.
